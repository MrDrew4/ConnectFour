# ConnectFour

Currenctly working on a ConnectFour game in Java. Took some inspiration from https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall16/CSCI-UA.0101-009/notes/Lecture12.pdf, but I am trying to add some of my own features and additional documentation on the code to make it more readable and understandable.

I'm also working on the feature of playing against the computer rather than just being a two player game. Also want to add winner counter.
